# MegaProbe Lab

Sources to the
[MegaProbe lab web pages](http://ccom.uprrp.edu/~humberto/megaprobe/). This
website uses the [pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/) static site generator.

If you are a member of my lab,
[fork this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/),
write a brief description of yourself and your project, and send me a
[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). You
can write articles and pages in
[markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) or
[restructured text](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickstart.html)
format (I mostly use markdown). 

Use the appropriate category for your document, for now, one of
Journal Club,
People, Projects or Publications. Tag the document with the name of
the project(s).

If you need to sharpen your git skills, a good place to start is
[the software carpentry git tutorial](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/).
If I edit your files after you do, you will need to pull my changes
back into your repository. This will require two steps:
[setting an upstream](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork)
and
[syncing your fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/).
