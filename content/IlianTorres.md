#Biography
Hello!

My name is Ilian Torres Trinidad and I am a student at the University of Puerto Rico - Rio Piedras Campus. I am a first mayor Mathematics student and a second major Computer Science student. I am currently doing a research
at the university on Techniques for Anomaly Detection in Network Flows with Dr.Humberto Ortiz-Zuazaga. My investigation experience consists on one semester investigation with Dr. Patricia Ordoñez.
I also participated in a program called BD2k which stands for Big data to knowledge sponsored by the University of Puerto Rico - Rio Piedras Campus. In this program I went to investigate at the University of California, Santa Cruz where I worked with Holly Beale and Melissa Cline in quality control, combination and analysis of raw genome sequence data to locate data of questionable quality. 
In this summer internship I worked with creating a python script that separated the data due to its content, uploaded it to R studio and the went on to test the data. 
The R code can be seen in this github repository->: <https://github.com/ucsc-cgl/cohort_qc>
My research internships include but are not limited to cyber security research and biomedical research in the biostatistics area. 

My email is <torresilian@gmail.com>.


##Project Descrition:
My project is to improve a working code of anomaly detection in network flows made by Bianca I. Colón Rosado and Ivan O. Garcia using the Benford Law and the subspace method.
