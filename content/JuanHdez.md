### Juan F. Hernandez Jose
  
## Biography

My name is Juan F. Hernandez Jose, I was born in Dominican Republic and raised in San Juan Puerto Rico. I'm a computer science undergraduate student, I began doing research with Dr. Humberto Ortiz-Zuazaga in January 21, 2020. My career short-term goals are to finish my degree in Computer Science, in May 2023. Furthermore, my long-term goals are to pursue graduate studies in Bioinformatics and analyzing biomedical experiments for people with diabetes. Because I still don't have much experience doing research I am doing a lot of reading on the bioinformatics field. This semester I hope to learn more and be able to work in a real proyect along side Humberto and my other lab partners.   

## Additional Need-To-Know Information

+ I consider myself a realistic person with a good sense of humor. My humor consists usually of sarcastic humor and irony in society.
+ I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when I was 2 years old.
+ I study computer science to find a way to improve the lives of diabetic patients like me but I'm always open to new ideas. 
+ I really like socializing with friends I can last hours on that.
+ I like to help others and solves problems but sometimes that's a problem, because if someone needs me, I can't say no.
