```
#### Week 1: August 19, 2019 - August 23, 2019
+ Read the paper about "These Are Not the K-mers You Are Looking For: Efficient Online K-mer Counting Using a Probabilistic Data Structure"
+ Started reading the paper about "Deep learning for genomics. A concise overview"

#### Week 2: August 26, 2019 - August 30, 2019
+ Read the paper about "Gene expression inference with deep learning."
+ Looked for different methods of Machine Learning related with gene expression.
+ Attend lab meeting for Roberto Herrera presentation on DeNovo Congenital Heart Disease.

#### Week 3: September 2, 2019 - September 6, 2019
+ Continue working with the Gene expression paper.
+ Lab meeting cancel.
+ Hopefully next week will start making the presentation of the paper. 

#### Week 4: September 9, 2019 - September 13, 2019 
+ Finish reading the Gene expression paper.
+ Study for class exams didn't accomplish much for the research.

#### Week 5: September 16, 2019 - September 20, 2019
+ Finish the presentation for the lab meeting.
+ Presented on friday.
+ Settle on new instructions to start looking for ways we can incorporate the paper results in our work.

#### Week 6: September 23, 2019 - September 27, 2019
+ Didn't advance in regard with the research, was doing university work.
+ Attend lab meeting with Roberto presentation.

#### Week 7: September 30, 2019 - October 4, 2019
+ Started downloading the D-GEX git project.
+ Working with the code, and requisities to replicate what they accomplish in the paper.
+ Attend lab meeting, Miguel presentation.

### Week 8: October 7, 2019 - October 11, 2019
+ Attend BSidesPR Conference.
+ Lab meeting cancel.

#### Week 9: October 14, 2019 - October 18, 2019
+ We attempt to install the new graphic card into Hulk but we failed.
+ We broked Hulk, waiting on new instructions from the professor.
+ Lab meeting cancel, professor had a meeting in medical science.
+ Still learning the paper code.

#### Week 10: October 21, 2019 - October 25, 2019
+ Hulk was repaired and the professor gave me access to an account.
+ I went on a trip on Thursday 24 to Monday 28.

#### Week 11: October 28, 2019 - November 1, 2019
+ I returned from a trip then went to SACNAS Conference.

### Week 12: November 4, 2019 - November 8, 2019
+ Got back from SACNAS.
+ Attend lab meeting, professor asign Briknie to work with me.
+ Downloaded the data from the project and uploaded it to hulk.

### Week 13: November 11, 2019 - November 15, 2019
+ Work on an environment in hulk to download all the packages.
+ Started debugging the files and tried to download the necessary libraries.
+ Working on some run time errors.

### Weeks 14,15,16,17: November 18, 2019 - December13, 2019
+ We encounter errors that we could not solve.
+ We determine that we could not reproduce the paper project.
+ We will change the approach we take for the next semester project. 

### Week 1 : February 3, 2020 - February 7, 2020
+ Talk to the professor and determine I'm going to take the diffhash project with Briknie.
+ We ran the diffhash code and started to read the papers from Angel and Roberto project. 
+ Hopefully this next week we can find a way to incorporate real data into the diffhash algorithm.
+ This week we also worked with the abstract for SIDIM that will take place on March 6, 2020. 

### Week 2 : February 10, 2020 - February 10, 2020
+ This week I didn't do much work in the lab since I was away on an Open House trip to the University of Colorado.

### Week 3 : February 17, 2020 - February 21, 2020
+ Finally understood some of what the code was doing and what I needed to change.
+ Briknie helped me in how to manage real data and implementing it to the script.
+ Ran the script with what is suppose to be real data, don't yet understand the output of the program.

### Week 4 : February 24, 2020 - February 28, 2020
+ Talk to the professor about the project, he explained that we needed to use the cucumber data for the diffhash.
+ The professor created a "data" directory in hulk so that we could transfer the data that we have so we don't ran out of memory
+ Change the working directory of the diffhash and ran the code.
+ The code finished running on Sunday March 1,2020 but it did not gave out the information we hope for.
+ No lab meeting on friday, the professor had a meeting

### Week 5 : March 2, 2020 - March 6, 2020
+ Ran the code again, last time it took 4 days so we hoped that we would get some results before the poster presentation.
+ The program gave us the result we expected, and we finally started working on the poster.
+ Friday we presented at the SIDIM Conference, therefore no lab meeting.
