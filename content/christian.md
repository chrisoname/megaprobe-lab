# Bio:
Bonjour! I do not know french. I'm a Chemistry major that recently discovered the world of Computer Science, 
jumped into a Bioinformatics lab, and am hoping not to drown here. I'm part of an undergraduate, diversity oriented, 
neuroscience research opportunity program called NeuroID. I dance classical ballet, play piano, and constantly 
avoid insults for not really enjoying watching movies. My favorite word is "bubbly".
