# Bio:
-  Hi, I'm Juan Lugo-Torres, a level 4 Computer Wizardry Student of the University of Puerto Rico - Rio Piedras.

Now I find myself under the tutelage of the Great Wizard Humberto Ortiz-Zuazaga, and through effort, knowledge, and will-power I shall ascend the ranks to become a renowned wizard myself.
