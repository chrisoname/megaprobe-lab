Title: About

The MegaProbe Lab, directed by [Humberto
Ortiz-Zuazaga](http://ccom.uprrp.edu/~humberto/), studies systems by
querying with millions of probes at a time. One example is in a
genetic system, where the probes are spots on a microarray or
individual sequence reads. Another example is cyberinfrastructure,
where a probe is a network flow or an individual network packet.

Our mascot is [Mega Probe](http://boboiboy.wikia.com/wiki/Mega_Probe),
a character in a Malasian animated series.
