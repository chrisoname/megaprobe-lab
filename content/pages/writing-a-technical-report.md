Title: Writing a technical report
Slug: writing-a-technical-report


# Introduction

Students doing research in megaprobe lab are required to prepare a
technical report each semester. This documents provides guidance on
preparing a technical report.

# Methods

## General instructions

Use a [guide][] like [the one Bianca Colon posted][bianca] to the megaprobe-lab
group. Turn in a draft before the end of the semester, so I can make
suggestions. Have another student read your draft before submitting it.

I much prefer LaTeX, you can share your overleaf or sharelatex project
with me and I can make suggestions or corrections right in the
document.

A technical report should at a minimum contain the following:

1. Title
1. Authors
1. Affiliations
1. Abstract (write it last)
1. Introduction
1. Methods
1. Results
1. Conclusions
1. Future work
1. Acknowledgments
1. References

## Veteran students

If you have decent results, emphasize your new results, the methods
you used, and enough introduction to comprehend the methods and
results.

## New students

If you are a new student in the lab, your technical report will
probably be short on results. Do an introduction to the problem you
are studying, and present a plan for future semesters.

# Results

See the publications page on the megaprobe site to see example technical reports.

# Conclusion

Every student in megaprobe lab should write a technical report every
semester. Follow the above guidelines and examples to do a good job.
